# Personal Digital Assistant Display

This is my first project in my journey of learning React. It's a basic project that covers some essential concepts of React.

## Project Description

The project displays personal digital assistant cards on the webpage. These cards represent AI-powered voice chat programs such as Alexa, Cortana, and Siri. Each card includes the image or logo of the assistant, their name, an imaginary Twitter handle, and a short description. 

The project demonstrates the concept of creating reusable components in React. Each card is a reusable component that looks similar except for the text and image.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main JavaScript files in the `src` folder:

- `ProfileCard.js`: This file defines the `ProfileCard` component, which is a reusable component that represents a single card.
- `index.js`: This is the entry point of the application.
- `App.js`: This file defines the `App` component, which is the root component of the application.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- React.js
- Bulma: A free open-source CSS framework.
